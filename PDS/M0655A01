Y          Value must reside at position 1 line 1

   Y/N    "JOB A" updates this setting.  Used by "JOB B"
          to determine if "JOB B" should wait or run.

          The waiting job contains MIS0655B which checks
          this member and waits for a 'Y' unless
          reverse = Y in PARM02, then it waits for 'N'.

   H      H = hold.  Job will wait for Y or N.
          Have your system set this to H prior to CICS shutdown,
          and set to Y after CICS fully up.

   #      To manually cause the job waiting on this parm
          to issue a cond code, change value above to:
          0  =   issue cond code 0000
          4  =   issue cond code 0004
          6  =   issue cond code 0016
          8  =   issue cond code 0008

   X      Job interval code:
          A01B02C03D04E05F07G10I12J15K18L20M25O30P35Q40R45S50T55U60
          Alpha value is converted to number of minutes (ie: A=01).
          The next job to reference this parm with MIS0655B will
          delay ## minutes before running.
