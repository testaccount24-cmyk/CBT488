    Notes for XLT04660

    XLT04660 was written to supress printing total pages
      if all the totals are zeroes or blank.  It will supress all
      pages for a given department even if the totals only occur
      on the last page.

    XLT04660 loops through a report file three times:
      1)  determine pages that match search criteria
      2)  inspect up to 40 lines of totals and submit a sort
          record if all totals are zero or blank
      3)  compare sort records to report file and keep or zap
          pages accordingly

    XLT04660 finds "groups" of header/value search fields.
    The program finds a "first" page and a "last" page
    for whatever search criteria are specified.
    It will generate up to 100 individual groups for a given set
    of search criteria when the criteria change and then
    change back.  Once the 100th set is reached then it only
    tracks the last page - intervening changes are considered
    part of the group.

    For example, if looping through a report searching for
    "Department: 450" then this example shows how it bundles
    the groups:

    Department: 450    page 1      group     1
    Department: 600    page 2
    Department: 700    page 3
    Department: 450    page 4      group     2
    Department: 450    page 5      group     2
    Department: 600    page 6
    Department: 450    page 7      group     3
    Department: 600    page 8
    Department: 450    page 9      group     4
    .
    .
    Department: 450    page 122    group    99
    Department: 600    page 123
    Department: 450    page 124    group   100
    Department: 600    page 125    group   100
    Department: 600    page 126    group   100
    Department: 450    page 127    group   100

    assuming there are 99 of these groupings prior to page 123,
    then as of page 123 the first and last occurrance of the
    search item constitue a group, even if other "breaks" in
    the group exist.

    group
        1  first page   1   last page   1
        2  first page   4   last page   5
        3  first page   7   last page   7
        4  first page   9   last page   9
        .
        .
      100  first page 124   last page 127

    Given that most reports list departments etc in sort order
    then this should not be an issue.  If your search criteria
    repeat in various locations within a single report and the
    report is massive or you've concatenated multiple reports
    within the REPORTI DD and there is no way to more uniquely
    identify the groups then you will need a different tool
    such as Monarch or a Cray supercomputer or a scissors
    unless the report is perforated then you can pull the pages
    apart unless there are multiple groups on a page then you may
    still need the scissors or just fold the page and tear -
