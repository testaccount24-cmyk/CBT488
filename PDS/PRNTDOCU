   PRNTFILE: list fixed length files.

       Advantages vs IDCAMS:
            - up to 39 records per page vs IDCAMS 12
            - ease of finding location of data in record
            - ability to print segments of a record
            - easy to read

       Disadvantages:
            - longer setup time, including a recompile anytime
              you change file names
            - must know record length, location of key, location
              and length of search key
            - inability to print special characters correctly
            - inability to print hex characters
            - unsupported

       Recommendations:
            - use IDCAMS for most applications. if you will be
              working with a file for an extended period, it may
              be beneficial to setup and use PRNTFILE for that file.

   to use PRNTFILE:
   ----------------
        PRNTFILE is designed so the source program does not need
        to be touched.

        1) change PRNTCPY1 and PRNTCPY2 in userid.ISPF.FILE488
           - if sequential, asterisk out the indexed file handling
             areas and change the file length.
           - if indexed, asterisk out the sequential file handling
             areas and change the record description to include
             the correct location of the key for the file.
             ex:   filler   pic x(10)   (10 bytes before key)
                   key      pic x(07)   (key in position 11)
                   filler   pic x(50)   (50 bytes after key)
                                        (67 byte record altogether)
             note: do not change the name of the key from 'infile-key'
                   or the name of the record from 'infile-record'

        2) recompile PRNTFILE using CX003B in userid.ISPF.FILE488
        3) if errors, the problem should be with the copybook
           changes. recheck them (they may have been changed by others).
        4) change PRNTPARM according to notes in parm
           - key to search has no relation to an indexed key.
             it is simply the first occurrence of that string to
             be found in the specified location.
           - file name is simply documentation and has no relation
             to the files CICS name, if any.
        5) change the name of the file in PRNTPROC (find 'infile')
        6) cross fingers and submit PRNTPROC.
