*      |
*    S A    header search criteria group set 'A'
*    S A    header search criteria group set 'A'

*  TOTALS
*----------------------------------------------------------
*
*  For totals, we go directly to the total value, bypassing
*    searching for headers such as "TOTALS" since they are often
*    listed apart from those values.
*
*  When specifying the totals field, be sure to include leading spaces
*    ie:    position 10 length 1 might be  ....+....+....+....+
*                                              340000
*    where a '0' appears in position 10 so the total is assumed to be
*    zero when in fact it is '340000'.  This should instead be
*    specified as:  position 5 length 6    ....+....+....+....+
*    so the search finds '     0'                   0
*
*  Also note that the "totals field" search field can be any
*    set of characters up to 20 bytes long.  The program will search
*    for whatever characters are entered in this field.
*
*
* T=totals definiton: must follow 'S' types
* | group character matching header definition above
* | | report line where totals start
* | | |   report line where totals end, or '000' if only on one line
* | | |   |   column containing totals
* | | |   |   |
* | | |   |   |   spaces or 'BLANK' means totals do not print on report
* | | |   |   |   |  if zero, ie  defined as ZZZZZZ or 'BLANK WHEN ZERO'
* | | |   |   |   |  otherwise this is the totals field as it appears
* | | |   |   |   |  on the report when zero's
* | | |   |   |   |  ie:       0
* | | |   |   |   |         0.00       length of total field or '00'
* | | |   |   |   |     0,000.00       |
