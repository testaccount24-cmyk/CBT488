   OFFSET DATE PROCESSING

   The 'offset date processing' system is designed to handle
   the situation where batch processing runs past midnight.
   If your shop has a system that handles processing date
   regardless of actual current date then disregard this documentation.
   We use SHARED MEDICAL SYSTEMS INVISION.  Along with INVISION,
   we also run a bunch of 'post-Invision' jobs.  This offset
   processing applies to them.

   If your shop runs batch jobs that simply grab and plug current
   date from the system, then the 'offset date processing' system
   might prove useful.

   It allows all batch jobs to calculate the processing date via
   one parm entry (in this case, see member MIS10010).
   if the parm contains -00000, then no offset occurs.
   if the parm contains -00001, then dates are offset by one day.

   The operators manually change -00000 to -00001 if batch
   processing runs past midnight.  (Actually we have this somewhat
   automated - the operator can determine that batch will be
   late and enters a command to cause the midnight job (MID99)
   to respond '-00001' rather than 'SKIP' to the prompt).

   Generated date symbolics residing in jobs submitted after
   midnight will then reflect the offset date.

   We handle variable date processing as follows:

   a 'J' job runs before each 'P' job that contains date symbolics
       example: on december 4th, 2000
                JMIS20D runs before PMIS20D and updates CMDX=20001203
                to CMDX=20001204

       If JMIS20D runs after midnight, and the processing date is
       desired (20001204) rather than the current date (20001205)
       then if offset processing was requested (OFFX=Y) the date
       is adjusted.

   see OFFSET2 for more documentation.
