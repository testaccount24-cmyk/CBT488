          Set to Y.  Job will look at time of day, rather
          than this setting, to determine when to run


   Y/N    {note: list which jobs update this setting}
          {note: list which jobs reference this setting}

   H      H = hold.  Job will wait for Y or N.
          Have your system set this to H prior to CICS shutdown,
          and set to Y after CICS fully up.

          The waiting job contains MIS0655B which checks
          this member and waits for a 'Y' unless
          reverse = Y in PARM02, then it waits for 'N'.

          To manually cause the job waiting on this parm
          to issue a cond code and terminate:
          Change Y or N above to   0  =   issue cond code 0000
                                   4  =   issue cond code 0004
                                   8  =   issue cond code 0008
                                   6  =   issue cond code 0016


   X      Job interval code:

          Alpha value is converted to number of minutes (ie: A=01).
          The next job to reference this parm with MIS0655B will
          delay ## minutes before running.
