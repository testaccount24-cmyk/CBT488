     Documentation for MIS0585B - high extent checking/notification.
     This system also lists 'lost' extents (extents not deleted by
     normal delete utilities) and new extents.

 1.  setup a job that plugs dasd volumes into iehlist jcl
     for all dasd that you want tested

     see PMISA1D

 2.  Run PMISA2D (and others - we run PMISA2D through PMISA7D)

 3.  Run PMISA9D

     the header file SYSP.STVSSD.DASD.DSNOTE contains the following
     (line it up so the date is in position 60):

  B = optimal block size selected by dadsm    12/01/2000
  C = compression                             07:10
  E = extended format
  I = data set is a pdse                 DA = direct access
  R = data set is reblockable            PO = partitioned
  S = sms-managed dataset                PS = sequential
  U = no bcs entry exists for dataset    U  = undefined
  ? = see iehlist utilities manual       VS = vsam
  .

 note:
     iehlist does not give dataset attributes such as space usage.
     this system could be vastly improved if that were the case.
     also, occasionally a dataset is listed even though it is the
     file ahead of it in the sort that had high extents.
