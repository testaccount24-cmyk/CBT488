Hello Sam

Well since I've been updating this file recently and because I
have time on my hands I decided I might as well go all the way.

I altered most of the programs to look the same.  They all
generate lower-case display statements in the same layout.

I altered most JCL to be fairly uniform, trying to make it as
flexible as possible for most shops.

I renamed numerous members so if something was added or deleted
then it was intentional - for this update I just assumed
you'd replace everything.

These members have been added:
$UPDATE to track updates to CBT 488
S0400B
STV0400T
S0530B
STV0530T
CHNGTST
CHNGEXMP
M0425B
STV0530B
STV0150B
STV0270B

These members have been removed:
$UTILITY
CHNG005A
STV1270B
STV1280B

Lots of members were renamed which probably should have been
included in the added/removed list above.

I recompiled a few of the older programs just to be sure they
still worked and made a few tweaks.

Please see $UPDATE for most of the changes.  Thank you in advance -
hope this isn't too much trouble.
