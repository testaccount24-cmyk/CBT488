  HSM tends to create quite a few log files named as:

  HSMACT.H1.MIGLOG.D00341.T140120
  HSMACT.H1.MIGLOG.D00341.T180149

  The 'log consolidation system' reads the hsm activity logs
  that are 7 days old and writes the records to one sequential
  file.  The records are marked with a delete code (info messages
  delete sooner than migration messages, etc).  This file is
  used for historical reporting purposes, and to avoid scanning
  multiple files to obtain hsm info.

  PMISB1D does an IDCAMS listing on the HSM catalog, obtains
  HSM activity logs that are 7 days old, and builds JCL that
  is then submitted.  This job pulls the contents of those logs,
  writes their contents to a sequential file, and then optionally
  deletes the logs.  I call the sequential file the SUMMLIST file.

  PMIS34W maintains SUMMLIST, pruning unwanted records
  based on a user determined scale.


  The following header records should be connected together
  (making two records of 132 bytes each).
  It is used as a reference to SUMMLISTs contents.

Date--------Message-----------Fromvol----------RC----
-------Time----------Action----------Tovol-----------

  Another file, a PDS member, lists datasets that were
  not deleted due to HSM requirements.  This allows
  for manual deletion of those files.
  I call the file SUMMDSN.


  place the following documentation in the SUMMDSN pds -
  name the member 'WHAT'

  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  THIS PDS IS USED TO HOLD THE NAMES OF FILES THAT HSM TRIED TO
  DELETE BUT COULD NOT BECAUSE THE FILE HAD NOT YET BEEN BACKED UP
  BY HSM.  THIS CAN BE HANDLED AS FOLLOWS:

     -  RECALL THE DATASET AND GIVE IT A MANAGEMENT CLASS THAT
        DOES NOT REQUEST BACKUP (SUCH AS MQNI1)

     OR

     -  IF THE DATASET WAS BACKED UP BY THE NORMAL SVMC DFDSS
        BACKUPS, SIMPLY DELETE IT.

  SETUP AN EZYEDIT VARIABLE OF @JYY000, THEN (WITH HSMACT.H1.SUMMDSN
  AS DEFAULT LIBRARY) TYPE OVER THE YYDDD WITH THE JULIAN DATE.  THIS
  WILL BRING UP THE LIST OF DATASETS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS MEMBER.
  YOU CAN THEN DELETE AS NEEDED.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------

  Note: ezyedit is a CA product that greatly eases PDS member
        maintenance.  I even highly recommend it (yes - a CA
        product - but it was developed by Legent)
